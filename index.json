Forest ecosystems are complex adaptive systems, thus a multi-scale perspective and integrated landscape management approaches are needed to manage forests under increasing socio-ecological changes. One way to make forests more resilient to future threads is to increase functional diversity and redundancy at stand scale, and to optimize functional connectivity, centrality and modularity of forest patches in large fragmented landscapes. All this requires model-based evaluations of future landscape trajectories and a detailed analysis of the forested landscape as a functional complex network. This project aims at coupling simulation modelling with methods based on functional diversity and network analysis to determine strategic interventions at stand and landscape scale to maximize the resilience of the forests to known and unknown disturbances with the minimum effort.\nWe work with the spatially-explicit forest landscape model LANDIS-II with the physiologically-based extension PnET-Succession , upscaling biochemical processes (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration) from stand (1 ha) to landscape scale (\u0026gt;1M ha). We model forest landscape and disturbance dynamics in southern Quebec, testing alternative forest management strategies to increase forest resilience to changing climate and disturbance regimes.\nThe project follows three main research steps:\n to couple process-based models of stand- and landscape-scale of forest dynamics with functional diversity and network theory; to evaluate multi-scale forest management options to maintain and increase resilience under scenarios of climate and global change (incl. unexpected disturbances), to determine threshold levels of both fragmentation and functional diversity below which the overall resilience of a landscape is threatened under combinations of pulse and press disturbances.  This project will test novel and innovative ways to implement resilience-based forest management for large fragmented forest landscapes that are typical of temperate ecosystems.\nThe project has been financed in 2018-2019 via a career funding scheme awarded to Marco Mina by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Postdoc Mobility Grant N. 175101).

This is reflected in unexpected disturbance events, as well as new and increasing socio-economic demands, all of which are affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide and the provision of important ecosystem services. This Anthropocene era is forcing us to reconsider past and current forest management and silvicultural practices, and search for new ones that are more flexible and better at dealing with the increasing uncertainty brought about by these accelerating and cumulative global changes. Here, we briefly review the focus and limitations of past and current forest management and silvicultural practices mainly as developed in Europe and North America. We then discuss some recent promising concepts, such as managing forests as complex adaptive systems, and approaches based on resilience, functional diversity, assisted migration and multi-species plantations, to propose a novel approach to integrate the functionality of species-traits into a functional complex network approach as a flexible and multi-scale way to manage forests for the Anthropocene. This approach takes into consideration the high level of uncertainty associated with future environmental and societal changes. It relies on the quantification and dynamic monitoring of functional diversity and complex network indices to manage forests as a functional complex network. Using this novel approach, the most efficient forest management and silvicultural practices can be determined, as well as where, at what scale, and at what intensity landscape-scale resistance, resilience and adaptive capacity of forests to global changes can be improved.","tags":null,"title":"The functional complex network approach to foster forest resilience to global changes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mina M.","Bugmann H.","Motta R.","Cailleret M."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"f69cdcb75a5389bd137a5af5c10c81c9","permalink":"https://mrcmina.github.io/publication/mina_2019_sherwood/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mina_2019_sherwood/","section":"publication","summary":"Adverse climate change effects might compromise the future provision of crucial ecosystem services (ES) from European mountain forests.

We aim for a better understanding of the different modes of intra and inter-specific competition in two- and three-species mixed forests. How can the effect of different modes of competitive interactions be detected and integrated into individual tree growth models? Are species interactions in spruce–fir–beech forests more associated with size‐symmetric or size‐asymmetric competition? Do competitive interactions between two of these species change from two‐ to three‐species mixtures? LOCATION. Temperate mixed‐species forests in Central Europe (Switzerland). METHODS. We used data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory to fit basal area increment models at the individual tree level, including the effect of ecological site conditions and indices of size‐symmetric and size‐asymmetric competition. Interaction terms between species‐specific competition indices were used to disentangle significant differences in species interactions from two‐ to three‐species mixtures. RESULTS. The growth of spruce and fir was positively affected by increasing proportions of the other species in spruce–fir mixtures, but negative effects were detected with increasing presence of beech. We found that competitive interactions for spruce and fir were more related to size‐symmetric competition, indicating that species interactions might be more associated with competition for below‐ground resources. Under constant amounts of stand basal area, the growth of beech clearly benefited from the increasing admixture of spruce and fir. For this species, patterns of size‐symmetric and size‐asymmetric competitive interactions were similar, indicating that beech is a strong self‐competitor for both above‐ground and below‐ground resources. Only for silver fir and beech, we found significant changes in species interactions from two‐ to three‐species mixtures, but these were not as prominent as the effects due to differences between intra‐ and inter‐specific competitio .CONCLUSIONS. Species interactions in spruce–fir–beech, or other mixed forests, can be characterized depending on the mode of competition, allowing interpretations of whether they occur mainly above or below ground level. Our outcomes illustrate that species‐specific competition indices can be integrated in individual tree growth functions to express the different modes of competition between species, and highlight the importance of considering the symmetry of competition alongside competitive interactions in models aimed at depicting growth in mixed‐species forests.","tags":null,"title":"The symmetry of competitive interactions in mixed Norway spruce , silver fir and European beech forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Most of the time we tend to think about forests as sources of important ecosystem service.

On average, the mixture had a negative effect on the growth of Picea abies. However, this effect decreased as moisture availability increased. Fagus sylvatica grew better in mixtures and this effect increased with site quality. A significant interaction between species proportions and quadratic mean diameter, a proxy for stand age, was found for both species.

However, complementarity effects for any given tree species are difficult to generalize because they can vary greatly along gradients of climatic conditions and resource availability. Identifying the conditions where species diversity can positively influence productivity is crucial. To date, few studies have examined how growth complementarity across species and mixture types is modulated by stand and environmental factors, and fewer have considered more than one or two factors. We investigated how complementarity effects for several major Central European tree species change with climatic and edaphic conditions, and with stand structural characteristics, including species composition. We used data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory, which is based on 3,231 plots of pure and mixed stands (19 mixture types) across a broad environmental gradient, to test (i) how mixing effects change depending on the identity of the admixed species and (ii) if complementarity consistently increases when environmental conditions become harsher. The magnitude, whether positive or negative, of complementarity increased with increasing stand density and stand developmental stage, but no general pattern could be identified across mixture types. Complementarity for many species increased as drought intensity and temperature increased, but not for all species and mixture types. While soil conditions, nitrogen and site topography influenced complementarity for many species, there was no general pattern (increases and decreases were observed). Synthesis . Our study indicates that complementarity varies strongly with stand density and stand development as well as with topographic, climatic and soil conditions. This emphasizes the need to account for site‐dependent conditions when exploring mixture effects in relation to forest productivity. We found that under certain conditions (i.e. increasing drought, higher temperature), mixed forests can promote individual tree growth in Central European temperate forests. However, careful assessments depending on the species composing the stands are required under changing resource availability as well as under different levels of stand density and development.","tags":null,"title":"Multiple factors modulate tree growth complementarity in central European mixed forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project duration 2016-2018 (completed)\nProject overview Integrating Species Mixtures in Tree Growth Functions for Forest Development Models in Switzerland (Swiss-SpeMixMod)\nThe interest for mixed-species forests has been rising during the past years. There is a broad consensus that forests with higher species diversity are likely to be more adaptable to climate change, resilient to disturbances and provider of a higher level of ecosystem services. Although several studies showed that under certain conditions mixed-species forests can be more productive than single-species stands, the representation of species interactions in empirical forest scenario models has not received much attention so far.\nThe main objective of this project is to investigate methodologies for quantifying the effects of species mixtures on tree growth along Switzerland’s environmental gradients, and to prepare this knowledge for the use in forest scenario calculations. The project comprises of three major parts: (1) a systematic, descriptive analysis of data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) to provide an overview of the frequency and the distribution of pure and mixed forests in Switzerland; (2) quantification of mixing effects with nonlinear mixed-effect models fitted to NFI data and their variability with climatic, edaphic, stand and site conditions, as well as with species composition, across Switzerland’s environmental gradient; (3) identification of the different modes of intra- and inter-specific interactions using competition indices in Swiss mixed-species forests and their integration in growth functions.\nThe project advances the understanding of the effects of species mixtures on tree growth under a broad range of environmental conditions in Switzerland. Additionally, it prepares this knowledge for further development of state-of-the-art forest scenario models, which are crucial tools for estimating potential wood supply and for supporting management decisions.\nThe project has been carried out by researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, Birmesdorf, Switzerland. Part of the project was developed in partnership with INIA Madrid, Spain who hosted Marco Mina for a research stay in January and May 2017.\nThe project has been supported by a grant from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) under the framework of the COST Action FP1206 EuMIXFOR of the European Union.\nPartners and collaborators  \rEsther Thurig, WSL Birmensdorf - project lead \rBrigitte Rohner, WSL Birmensdorf - deputy project lead Markus Huber, WSL Birmensdorf - project partner \rPeter Brang, WSL Birmensdorf - project partner \rPetia Simeonova Nikolova WSL Birmensdorf - project partner  Key publications Mina M, Huber MO, Forrester DI, Thürig E, Rohner B (2018) Multiple factors modulate tree growth complementarity in central European mixed forests.

Simulations under the current climate revealed a decrease in fir proportion from 53% in 2010 to 14–37% in 2110, while the proportion of spruce remained relatively constant (13% in 2010 and 9–13% in 2110). Climate change may intensify the decline of both species along an elevation gradient. An upward shift was projected for f ir in the observed period; in low-elevation stands (600–800 m a.s.l.), fir could almost disappear, while at high elevations (1050–1400 m a.s.l.), our simulations projected an increase in the proportion of both fir and spruce. No single management strategy proved to be significantly beneficial for either species. The most promising strategies were the fir conservation-oriented scenario and the exclusion of browsing; large ungulates strongly impacted the development of fir, but not that of spruce.

To evaluate whether adverse climate change effects on ES can be counteracted by adapting management, dynamic models and indicator-based assessments are needed. We applied a forest dynamic model in case study areas of four European mountain regions and evaluated the future supply of four ES – timber production, carbon sequestra-tion, biodiversity and protection against natural hazards – using state-of-the-art ES indica-tors. Forest dynamics were simulated under three management scenarios (no management, business-as-usual and alternative management) and five climate change projections for selected representative stand types in each region. We analysed potential trade-offs and syn-ergies between ES and evaluated future changes among regions, forest stands, climate and management scenarios. Impacts of climate change on the provision of multiple ES were found to be highly hetero-geneous and to depend on the region, site and future climate. In the absence of large-scale natural disturbance (not considered), protection services, carbon stock and deadwood abun-dance (proxy for biodiversity) benefitted from no management in all regions.

In this context, dynamic models are indispensable to assess the combined effects of management and climate change on forest dynamics. We evaluated the importance of implementing different approaches for simulating forest management in the climate-sensitive gap model ForClim and compared its outputs with forest inventory data at multiple sites across the European Alps. The model was then used to study forest dynamics in representative silver fir–European beech stands in the Dinaric Mountains (Slovenia) under current management and different climate scenarios. On average, ForClim accurately predicted the development of basal area and stem numbers, but the type of harvesting algorithm used and the information for stand initialization are key elements that must be defined care-fully. Empirical harvesting functions that rigorously impose the number and size of stems to remove fail to reproduce stand dynamics when growth is just slightly under-or overestimated, and thus should be substituted by analytical thinning algorithms that are based on stochastic distribution functions. Long-term simulations revealed that both management and climate change negatively impact conifer growth and regeneration. Under current climate, most of the simulated stands were dominated by European beech at the end of the simulation (i.e., 2150 AD), due to the decline of silver fir and Norway spruce caused mainly by harvesting. This trend was amplified under climate change as growth of European beech was favored by higher temperatures, in contrast to drought-induced growth reductions in both conifers. This forest development sce-nario is highly undesired by local managers who aim at preserving conifers with high economic value. Overall, our results suggest that maintaining a considerable share of conifers in these forests may not be feasible under climate change, especially at lower elevations where foresters should consider alternative management strategies","tags":null,"title":"Accurate modeling of harvesting is key for projecting future forest dynamics: a case study in the Slovenian mountains","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475658000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475658000,"objectID":"71eef6e1d8ba67069ca13e9181305f04","permalink":"https://mrcmina.github.io/talk/prague_oct16/","publishdate":"2016-10-05T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/prague_oct16/","section":"talk","summary":"Conference","tags":[],"title":"Integrating effects of species mixture into individual-tree growth models based on national forest inventory data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mina M."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475280000,"objectID":"657168ba6ac55b1738c322e85c936e1d","permalink":"https://mrcmina.github.io/publication/mina_2016_thesis/","publishdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mina_2016_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"In an era characterized by rapid changes of environmental, particularly climatic, and socio-economic conditions, there is a growing need to better understand the influence of these changes on forests and their capacity to provide key ecosystem services (ES) to human communities. Since climate change is particularly pronounced in mountain regions, mountain forests deserve particular attention to assess the impacts of these changes. Moreover, as forests develop slowly over decades to many centuries, possible adaptation measures must be planned in the long term as well, and they should be based on thorough scientific knowledge.Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are often used to investigate climatic influences on long-term forest dynamics, and more recently also to explore management impacts. Among the many types of DVMs, forest gap models are flexible tools to analyze future forest development, but management regimes have received little attention to date. Although these models include the inter-specific sensitivity to the environment, intra-specific local adaptation and intra-annual varia-tions in the environmental responses are not considered. This is especially important for capturing drought effects on growth and limits the reliability of gap models in drought-prone forests. The overall objective of this thesis was to evaluate the potentials and limitations of current and alternative forest management strategies on the provision of multiple ES in European mountain forests under climate change. To this end, I improved the gap model ForClim in two respects (1) the modeling of harvesting, and (2) the growth response to drought. I then applied the improved model in four mountain regions across central and southern Europe. I recommend that future studies that aim to assess the impacts of climate change under different management strategies should i) assess stand vulnerability to disturbance using a set of models that operate on different spatial scales; ii) expand the analysis to more stands and evaluate additional management strategies iii) quantify ecosystem services using multiple indicators or region-specific trait-based approaches iv) explore other assessment meth-odologies that consider non-linear interactions between ES. I demonstrated that DVMs are important and useful tools to assess the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on forest dynamics. As these impacts are likely to vary strongly among and within mountain regions, future studies should consider local and regional differences in environmental conditions and in stand structure. The role of small-scale forest management is especially crucial in these assessments, since its impact is likely to be more pronounced than the impact of climate change per se.","tags":null,"title":"Forest dynamics, management and ecosystem services: the future of European mountain forests in an era of climate change","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"When speculating on what is going to happen to our forests in an uncertain future, it is hard to generalize.

For accurately modeling tree functioning – and thus for producing reliable simulations of forest dynamics – the consideration of the variability in the timing and extent of drought effects on tree growth is essential, particularly in strongly seasonal climates such as in the Mediterranean area. Yet, most dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) do not include this intra-annual variability of drought effects on tree growth. We present a novel approach for linking tree-ring data to drought simulations in DVMs. A modified forward model of tree-ring width (VS-Lite) was used to estimate seasonal- and site-specific growth responses to drought of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), which were subsequently implemented in the DVM ForClim. Ring-width data from sixteen sites along a moisture gradient from Central Spain to the Swiss Alps, including the dry inner Alpine valleys, were used to calibrate the forward ring-width model, and inventory data from managed Scots pine stands were used to evaluate ForClim performance. The modified VS-Lite accurately estimated the year-to-year variability in ring-width indices and produced realistic intra-annual growth responses to soil drought, showing a stronger relationship between growth and drought in spring than in the other seasons and thus capturing the strategy of Scots pine to cope with drought. The ForClim version including seasonal variability in growth responses to drought showed improved predictions of stand basal area and stem number, indicating the need to consider intra-annual differences in climate–growth relationships in DVMs when simulating forest dynamics. Forward modeling of ring-width growth may be a powerful tool to calibrate growth functions in DVMs that aim to simulate forest properties in across multiple environments at large spatial scales.","tags":null,"title":"Forward modeling of tree-ring width improves simulation of forest growth responses to drought","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project duration 2012-2015 (completed)\nProject overview Advanced multifunctional management of European mountain forest RANGE (ARANGE)\nThe project Advanced multifunctional forest management in European mountain RANGEs evaluated the capacity of current forest management regimes and possible alternative future management to provide portfolios of ecosystem services (ES) from European mountain forests. The project included a wide range of forest types in the major European mountain ranges and seeks to develop and evaluate strategies for their multifunctional management under risk and uncertainty due to changing climate and socio-economic conditions. To analyse conflicts and complementarities among ES from stand to landscape scale, improved models for the assessment and projection of ES as well as novel planning and decision support tools have been developed and applied to regional case studies as informed by decision makers and other stakeholders in the study regions.\nThe overall aims of ARANGE have been:\n to investigate the potentials and limitations of current and possible future approaches to mountain forest management for providing portfolios of ES under current and future climatic and socio-economic conditions to identify related risks and uncertainties to translate the scientific state of knowledge about the efficient provision of multiple ES from mountain forests into decision support for policy makers and forest practitioners, so as to improve the robustness of planning tools in real-world decision making.  The project addressed four main ecosystem services:\n timber production protection against gravitational natural hazards the role of forests in climate change mitigation via carbon sequestration as well as bioenergy production, and nature conservation and the maintenance of biodiversity  In ARANGE, state-of-the-art models of forest dynamics at stand and landscape scales have be used.

Wood energy fuel cycle optimization (FCO) aims to provide cleaner burning fuels through optimization of forestry and renewable energy management practices. In this work, beech and spruce forests of average and high quality were modelled and analysed to determine the volume of fuel wood and its associated bark fraction produced during typical forestry cycles. Two separate fuel wood bark production regimes were observed for beech trees, while only one production regime was observed for spruce. The single tree and stand models were combined with existing thinning parameters to replicate existing management practices. Utilizing estimates of initial seedling numbers and existing thinning patterns a dynamic model was formed that responded to changes in thinning practices. By varying the thinning parameters, this model enabled optimization of the forestry practices for the reduction of bark impurities in the fuel wood supply chain. Beech forestry cycles responded well to fuel cycle optimization with volume reductions of bark from fuel wood of between ~10% and ~20% for average and high quality forest stands. Spruce, on the other hand, was fairly insensitive to FCO with bark reductions of 0–5%. The responsiveness of beech to FCO further supports its status as the preferred RWC fuel in Switzerland. FCO could easily be extended beyond Switzerland and applied across continental Europe and North America.","tags":null,"title":"Wood energy fuel cycle optimization in beech and spruce forests","type":"publication"}]
